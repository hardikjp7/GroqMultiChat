GroqMultiChat is a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) application that enables seamless interaction with multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) through the [Groq API](https://groq.com/). Users can select from various models to tailor their conversational experience. The app is publicly deployed and allows users to input their own API keys for personalized access.

## Features

- **User API Key Input**: Enter your own Groq API key via the sidebar for personalized interactions.
- **Public Deployment**: Access the app directly through its public URL without any local setup.
- **Chat History**: Maintains a session-based chat history for a continuous conversation flow during your session.
